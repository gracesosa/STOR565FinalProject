# STOR565FinalProject

Abusive Tweet Classification Machine Learning NLP Project
Spring 2024

- Utilized TF-IDF Vectorizer to vectorize tokenized tweets and comments
- Additionally utilized Word2Vec to generate word embeddings to train the neural network

Updated Performance Metrics from the following models:
- Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

 should be located in 'testing_models.ipynb'.
